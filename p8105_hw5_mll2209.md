## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate…

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

``` r
city_prop_test = function(df) {
  n_unsolved ...
  n_total ...
  prop.test(.....)
}
```

    ## Error: <text>:2:14: unexpected symbol
    ## 1: city_prop_test = function(df) {
    ## 2:   n_unsolved ...
    ##                 ^

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>%
  nest(data = resolved)
```

## Problem 2

import one dataset

``` r
data_1 = read_csv("lda_data/con_01.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   week_1 = col_double(),

    ##   week_3 = col_double(),
    ##   week_4 = col_double(),
    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

Create tibble

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")
  )
path_df = 
  path_df %>%
  mutate(
    path = str_c("/lda_data/", path)) %>%
  mutate(
    data = map(path_df$path, read_csv)
  )


read_csv(path_df$path[1])
```

``` r
setwd("lda_data/")
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files()
  )
path_df = 
  path_df %>%
  mutate(
    data = map(path_df$path, read_csv)
  )
```

Tidy results

``` r
trial_unnest = 
  unnest(path_df, cols = data) %>%
  separate(path, sep = "_", into = c("arm", "subject_id")) %>%
  mutate(subject_id = str_replace(subject_id, "\\.csv", "")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "obs") %>%
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, "week_", "")) %>%
  mutate(arm = str_replace(arm, "con", "control")) %>%
  mutate(arm = str_replace(arm, "exp", "experimental"))
```

Spaghetti plot\!

``` r
  trial_unnest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obs, group = interaction(arm,subject_id), color = arm)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_mll2209_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

From the spaghetti plot, it seems that over time, the control group has
lower observations when compared to the experimental group.

## Problem 3

Setting the function

``` r
sim_t_test = function(n = 30, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
  
  sim_data %>%
    summarize(
      mu_hat = mean(x),
      sigma_hat = sd(x),
      t.test(sim_data, mu = 0, alternative = 'two.sided', paried = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95) %>%
      broom::tidy())
}
```

Set mu = 0, generate 5000 datsets from the model made above, save
mu\_hat and p-value for each dataset

``` r
output = vector("list", 50)

for (i in 1:50) {
  output[[i]] = sim_t_test(30)
}
sim_results = 
  bind_rows(output) %>%
  select(mu_hat, p.value)
```

Repeat the above for mu = 1 through 6

``` r
sim_results1 = 
  tibble(true_mu = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>%
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = true_mu, ~rerun(50, sim_t_test(mu = .x))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)) %>%
  select(-output_lists) %>%
  unnest(estimate_dfs) %>%
  select(true_mu, mu_hat, p.value)
```

Make plot showing proportion of times null was rejected

``` r
  sim_results1 %>%
  mutate(
    test  = case_when(
      p.value <= 0.05 ~ "reject",
      p.value > 0.05 ~ "fail to reject")) %>%
  select(-mu_hat, -p.value) %>%
  group_by(true_mu, test) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(reject_freq = n / sum(n)) %>%
  filter(test == "reject") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = true_mu, y = reject_freq)) + 
  geom_point()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'true_mu' (override with `.groups` argument)

<img src="p8105_hw5_mll2209_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="90%" />
As the effect size increases, the power of the test also increases,
until it becomes large enough and plateaus at 1.

Make plot showing average estimate of mu hat and true mu. Make second
plot with average estimate of mu hat for which the null was rejected and
the true value of mu

``` r
plot1 = 
  sim_results1 %>%
  mutate(
    test  = case_when(
      p.value <= 0.05 ~ "reject",
      p.value > 0.05 ~ "fail to reject")) %>%
  group_by(true_mu) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(mu_hat)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = true_mu, y = mean)) +
  geom_point()
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot2 = 
  sim_results1 %>%
  mutate(
    test  = case_when(
      p.value <= 0.05 ~ "reject",
      p.value > 0.05 ~ "fail to reject")) %>%
  filter(test == "reject") %>%
  group_by(true_mu) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(mu_hat)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = true_mu, y = mean)) +
  geom_point()
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
library(patchwork)
plot1 + plot2
```
