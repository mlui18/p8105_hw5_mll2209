## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate…

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

``` r
city_prop_test = function(df) {
  n_unsolved ...
  n_total ...
  prop.test(.....)
}
```

    ## Error: <text>:2:14: unexpected symbol
    ## 1: city_prop_test = function(df) {
    ## 2:   n_unsolved ...
    ##                 ^

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>%
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ## )

## Problem 2

import one dataset

``` r
data_1 = read_csv("lda_data/con_01.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   week_1 = col_double(),
    ##   week_2 = col_double(),
    ##   week_3 = col_double(),
    ##   week_4 = col_double(),
    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

Create tibble

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")
  )
path_df = 
  path_df %>%
  mutate(
    path = str_c("/lda_data/", path)) %>%
  mutate(
    data = map(path_df$path, read_csv)
  )


read_csv(path_df$path[1])
```

``` r
setwd("lda_data/")
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files()
  )
path_df = 
  path_df %>%
  mutate(
    data = map(path_df$path, read_csv)
  )
```

Tidy results

``` r
trial_unnest = 
  unnest(path_df, cols = data) %>%
  separate(path, sep = "_", into = c("arm", "subject_id")) %>%
  mutate(subject_id = str_replace(subject_id, "\\.csv", "")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "obs") %>%
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, "week_", "")) %>%
  mutate(arm = str_replace(arm, "con", "control")) %>%
  mutate(arm = str_replace(arm, "exp", "experimental"))
```

Spaghetti plot\!

``` r
  trial_unnest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obs, group = interaction(arm,subject_id), color = arm)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_mll2209_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

From the spaghetti plot, it seems that over time, the control group has
lower observations when compared to the experimental group.

## Problem 3

Setting the function

``` r
sim_t_test = function(n = 30, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
  
  sim_data %>%
    summarize(
      mu_hat = mean(x),
      sigma_hat = sd(x),
      t.test(sim_data, mu = 0, alternative = 'two.sided', paried = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95) %>%
      broom::tidy())
}
```

Set mu = 0, generate 5000 datsets from the model made above, save
mu\_hat and p-value for each dataset

``` r
output = vector("list", 50)

for (i in 1:50) {
  output[[i]] = sim_t_test(30)
}
sim_results = 
  bind_rows(output) %>%
  select(mu_hat, p.value)
```

Repeat the above for mu = 1 through 6

``` r
mu_list = 
list(
  "mu1" = 1,
  "mu2" = 2,
  "mu3" = 3,
  "mu4" = 4,
  "mu5" = 5,
  "mu6" = 6
  )

output1 = vector("list", length = 6)
  for (i in 1:6) {
     output1[[i]] = rerun(50, sim_t_test(mu = mu_list[[i]])) %>%
     bind_rows
  }

sim_results1 = 
  bind_rows(output1) %>%
  select(mu_hat, p.value)
```
